# Amazon-Product-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Python
#Amazon gives a platform to small businesses and companies with modest resources to grow larger. And Because of its popularity, people actually spend time and write detailed reviews, about the brand and the product. So, by analyzing that data we can tell companies a lot about their products and also the ways to enhance the quality of the product. But that large amount of data can not be analyzed by a person.

1. Importing Libraries and Datasets
2. Preprocessing and cleaning the reviews 
3. Analysis of the Dataset
4. Converting text into Vectors
5. Model training, Evaluation, and Prediction
